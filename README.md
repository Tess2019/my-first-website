# My very first Web Page
Welcome to see my very first website!
I learned building my website as a part of my education with CodeInstitute Fullstack Developer program.
You are welcome to see my page [here](https://tess2019.github.io/my-first-website/)

## Description of my project
I learned how to use common development tools as Cloud9,Git and Github. The project helpt me to learn how to manage code and see how they developt to finally come together as my first website.

### The technology i used

I used **_HTML_** that gives my page structur and **_Css_** that decorates my web project with for example color and layout. Then i used **_Cloud9_** that support multiple programming languages. It also allow you to write, run and debug my code in just a browser.
My website is currently hosted on Github pages. **_Github_** is a web-based service for version control using Git.**_Git_** helps to track my work in my project files.
